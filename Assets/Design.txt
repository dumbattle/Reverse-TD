Creep Upgrades

    Resource type (if child, copy from parent) amount proportional to base count after specialization

Resource (Dust?)
    Upgrading attachments cost resource
    Different types
    Creeps can be set to reward certain resource
        Rare resource requires common resource to unlock -> sense of progression

    - Forces more creeps, encorages passing all creeps to get variety of resources


    Default creep wave will make 100 of whatever resource it is set to at lvl 1

    1 Default  - Green
    3 Common   - Red/Blue/Yellow
    1 Rare     - Diamond

Aquisition Rate
    - Level 1  -> 100 (Base line, 1 round max income)
        - Upgrade Rate?
            - 2-3  Cheap upgrades/Round
            - 2-3  Rounds for meddium upgrade
            - 5-10 Rounds for high tier upgrade
    - Level 10 -> ???

Cost Distribution
    Low    -> 0-500
    Medium -> 500 - 1000
    High   -> 1000 - 1500
    Slope  -> ratio of level 10 cost to level 1 cost
        - High Slope = cost is much cheaper at lower levels

    - Income
        - Green -> Low {G}
        - R/B/Y -> High {G}
        - D     -> Low {R}, {B}, {Y}
        - RBY   -> Low {G}, Medium{D}, high slope {D}
    - Specialization
        - Stat shift -> Low {G}, Low {R/G/B (Down attr)}, High {R/G/B (Up attr)}

    - Tier 1
        - HP/Spd/Rate -> Low {G}, Low high Slope {R/B/Y}
        - Count       -> Low {G},  Low {B},  Low {D},
            - Cost more b/c has high potential synergy with other upgrades
