Alternative  ============================================================================


    Specialization - {HP/SPD/RATE+Count-Money} increase 1 lower other 2, can opt not to
    Resource type (if child, copy from parent) amount proportional to base count after specialization

    Slot 1-3 - Basic stat increase (HP/SPD/RATE/COUNT) (Stackable)
    Slot 4-5 - Property (Regen/Resistance) (Stackable)
    Slot 6   - Child Spawn (Timer/On Death)
             - Periodic Heal/Clense

    Slot 7   - On Death Heal/Clense
             - Respawn on reach end

Resource (Dust?)
    Upgrading attachments cost resource
    Different types
    Creeps can be set to reward certain resource
        Rare resource requires common resource to unlock -> sense of progression

    - Forces more creeps, encorages passing all creeps to get variety of resources


    Default creep wave will make 100 of whatever resource it is set to at lvl 1

    1 Default  - Green
    3 Common   - Red/Blue/Yellow
    1 Rare     - Diamond
